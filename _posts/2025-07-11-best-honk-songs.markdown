A few months back, I thought it would be good stream content to go through the songs in Tony Hawk games and toss my favorite 25 into a list, maybe piss one or two people off by saying the Goldfinger songs suck ass, we all move on. But here's the thing: my brain doesn't work that way. Instead, I tormented myself with the whole thing. I thought it would be a breezy couple hours, but after only getting up to THPS3 after an entire stream and already having a list that well exceeded 25, I knew I was in too deep. So I changed the goal from Top 25 to Top 34, as if nine extra spaces would make much of a difference, because 34 is kind of like 3+4, the game that was at the time just officially announced. I did this for a few more streams and then finally gave up entirely, because it was too intimidating, 34 was too hard of a constraint, and god fucking damn there's a lot of songs in Tony Hawk games.

But so this whole thing wasn't a total waste of time, I will simply present it as it exists, in its pre-release form. Before I talk a little bit about the rationale behind my choices, let me explain some details. For the sake of my sanity I only considered choices from what I will call mainline Tony Hawk games. So that means the _THPS_ games, _THUG 1&2_, _THAW_, _Project 8_, and then the additional songs in the _THPS 1+2_ remake. There are in fact quite a few good songs in games like _Downhill Jam_ but it's not a real Tony Hawk game so I didn't care. And you know what, I actually totally forgot to get to _Proving Ground_. Well fuck. There's some good ones in there. But I had to abandon this whole thing so please understand. I don't have a single bit of nostalgia for that game anyway. I also obviously didn't include THPS 3+4, because it didn't exist then. Now it does. It seems pretty good.

Onto the selections: my criteria were some kind of hybrid of "how much I think the song fits" and "how much I actually like it", weighted more toward the latter. I did _not_ consider things like "what people consider iconic" (see: Goldfinger, who are bad). But the surprising thing to me is as I was accumulating the picks, how heavy it was on the rap/hip-hop tracks. I recognize the Tony Hawk games as having pretty good hip-hop soundtracks but as a teen there were only a select few here and there I'd have ever considered favorites. And yet for some of these games, I'd go through the soundtracks and struggle to find a single rock song worthy of the list and having several handfuls of rap songs. I guess I should expect my tastes to be different now than when I was like 15, but still.

I also tried to avoid picking the same artist more than once, though there's definitely a lot of overlap in the hip-hop songs. Whatever.

And so, here it is. I did one final passthrough and culled quite a few so the list isn't 100 long anymore. Did I take out a bunch I will later regret and leave on a bunch I end up not that enthusiastic about? Certainly. Did my initial process miss out on some of the best shit? Also certainly. Sometimes, however, you just gotta say "Who care", so: who care?
