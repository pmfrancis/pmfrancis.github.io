I'm writing this here really as a broad response to a Discord message, but for some reason Discord's Android app doesn't seem to work with a plugged in keyboard and I'm an old man who can't type on a phone. And so, here's the thing:

_My computer is fucked._

How fucked? Well, it's pretty impossible to say. I'm certainly no computer genius, but I'm not stupid either and I'm not sure where to start. I'll just break everything down real quick and rough-like to describe what's going on and the problems it causes.

# What happened
My computer hung while restarting to install an update on the screen where Windows attempts to close active programs before shutting down, forcing me to hard reset. Never something you want to do in the process of an OS update, but it wasn't actually updating yet and I had no other choice anyway. It went through with the update after the reset and I booted into Windows for what would be the last time. Although I did get into Windows, everything was clearly fucked. The taskbar took a minute-plus to appear, applications were slow to start, everything was unresponsive. I tried opening _Rocket League_ to see what would happen and it tossed me an error. I tried restarting and once again, it hung on the restart screen.

From there, I would never successfully get back into Windows again. Many times it would freeze on the BIOS loading screen, occasionally I could get into the Windows diagnostic screen or login screen but it would freeze before accepting any input.

# What could be wrong
It's really hard to say. The fact that it froze during an update process makes it more complicated. It could be that the freeze caused a data corruption that makes the OS basically unbootable. But it also could be that the freeze happened _because_ of a deeper hardware problem. If I had to really guess, I would say it's one of these things:

- **Busted motherboard.** I do get the operation code `AA` on the motherboard, which is effectively useless information. It basically means it _thinks_ everything is good, but clearly it is not.
- **Defective boot disk.** Potentially one of the cheaper fixes but also one of the worst in that it likely means a massive loss of data and let's be real, I am not much of a "back up" kind of person. More on this in a second.
- **Bad CPU?** Damn wouldn't this one suck.
- **Something else?** Who knows, computers are complex. Could be a lot of things.

# Complications
Without much information to go on, it's incredibly difficult to diagnose the issue. I am a bit of a tinkerer but not a rich enough guy to have spare compatible PC parts hanging out all over the place, so I can't just say ok let me swap out this motherboard or test out a different CPU or RAM or something. The best I could do is outright buy a new part and just hope I guessed right? That's (i) not a very good solution, and (ii) not something I can afford to do anyway.

And thanks to the "no physical media" world we live in, I can't even create a Windows boot disk to see if it's the m.2 that failed because you need a working computer to do such a thing. Infuriating.

# Why this sucks
I don't think I need to explain why not having a computer in 2023 sucks, but: it's basically where I do everything. It's how I have fun through games, it's how I keep in touch with people, it's how I listen to music and watch movies and the like. Chatting with a friend while we play some games is one of the things that's kept me alive the last few years. It's also how I stream, which even though I am not good at or even try to be good at, and certainly don't make much money from, I do enjoy doing. It's also, like, the way to find jobs, something I need. Can you imagine filling out or emailing an application from a phone? God.

# What you can do
Nothing insofar as I'm concerned. This world sucks ass for everyone out there and the idea of being like "hey, my like $2000 computer isn't working, woe is me please help" is abhorrent to me when there are better people with worse problems. At least I have family I have been able to live with while being a huge failure. Other people don't. Idk. Unless you're really rich I guess, then buy me a new computer and place to live and give all my friends money too imo.

Edit: I guess I should add that if you have any ideas re: diagnosis or what I should do that'd be a great help.

Not going to proofread this, I'm typing this in a shitty web-based text editor on the toilet and it's longer than I thought it would be or want it to be. Ok bye.

One more edit: I guess it makes some degree of sense to mention the things I have thus far tried, so:

# What I've tried
- Reflashing BIOS
- Both possible combinations of using one of the two RAM sticks (this briefly seemed promising as I was able to boot into Windows for maybe two minutes, but it then froze and thus was likely a fluke)
- Feeling fatalistic
