I don't know what I'm going to use this web's sight for or know why I bought this domain. I'd like to use it to get back into the habit of getting my thoughts down somewhere in a way that lets me ramble, but I doubt I'll commit to the bit.

You can catch me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.pee.fart.piss.cool), and sometimes I stream myself badly playing Super Mario World hacks, Rocket League, and other nonsense on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/tuffghost). Stop by sometime and say "hi".
